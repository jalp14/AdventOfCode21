# AdventOfCode21
Advent of Code 2021 solutions in Swift using Swift Playgrounds
I'll try and do all the challenges but who know ü§ì

# Instructions
Since this is done in Swift Playgrounds you can technically run this on the iPad.
- Clone the repo
- Open advent.playground in Xcode
- Run the code
- Success???

# Note
- Implementation can be found under the Sources sub-directory 
- Everything inside the Sources folder is public becuase Playgrounds needs it that way to access the code apparently üßê
